I created this blog adapting a template from Gatsby to practice using Gatsby and Contentful. I've resolved it's issues and made customisations afterwards.

## Technologies used
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/): styled component system
- [React Awesome Reveal](https://github.com/dennismorello/react-awesome-reveal)
- Typescript
- CMS Integration with [Contentful](https://contentful.com)
- Icons from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Google Analytics integration
